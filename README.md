# Rainbow Role

- This is a Rainbow Role Bot Source Code which can easily change a Role Color every x seconds.

- This is against Discord Terms of Service, so use it at your own risk!

# Setup

- You'll only need to do all setup in config.json File.

- Here is a short guide of setting config.json :-<br><br>botToken: Your Discord Bot Token<br>guildID: Your Server ID<br>roleIDs: List of Role IDs in an Array for which color should be changed.<br>interval: The Time in Milliseconds at which Role Colors should automatically change.

- The Changed Color would be random everytime.

# Note

- People think that my projects contains virus because they aren't able to read the code.

- The Code is Encoded so that no one gets access to edit the source or to remove credits.
